Theme
=====
Stuck in a loop

Concept
=======
essentially, you have limited time to create a path in some area where you are, triggering simple changes such as bridges, doors etc to get out
but once time runs out, all switches and state reverts to default
also, each thing takes time to change state
can find items which you can use on a trigger to make its state persistent (but not explained directly as such)
careful consideration needed to choose which ones
also thinking of another gameplay element that may be fun but depends on player count
namely a sort of minimal message writing system a la DS
with very simple fixed phrasing
similarities:
	- minit, whch is Link's Awakening only not
	- half minute hero, which is all about optimised battles and item usage, jrpg redux
this is going more for Myst/Riven, no battles, switches and environmental puzzles, but then rogue-like

Barrier types
=============
- step bridge
	- all at once
	- step by step
- door / force field / wind trap / etc
	- key
	- trigger (remote)
- rubble / wall / rock
	- explosion
	- collapse
	- tool
- turn bridge
	- single straight
	- t-bone
	- corner
- darkness
	- need light
		- item
		- triggered remotely
- water / sludge
	- shallow
		- slow movement
	- deep
		- cannot traverse unless item
- fire
	- extinguish
		- water flow chnange
		- item
		- weather change
- timed movement barrier
	- changes position at some point during the loop
	- can only or no longer proceed after this time
- elevation difference
	- need to find way around
	- place ladder
- broken path / bridge
	- gets fixed after N iterations
	- or due to world state change (next loop)

Trigger types
=============
- simple on/off switch
- button bash switch
- narrative delay switch
	- first try: "it's kinda stuck", 2nd: "it's getting looser", etc.
	- broken door, (randomly) opens a bit more and more each use
- (timed) step-on switch
	- e.g. need to hold position for N seconds
- broken switch
	- need to find lever or eqv.
- powered switch
	- need to enable power to use
	- insert battery / power plug (remotely)
- multi-switch / combination switch
	- need a certain combination of on/off to enable

Setting
=======
Unbound by theme, can be anything
Mostly bound by artistic skill to show environs
